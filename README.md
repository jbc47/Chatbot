# Chatbot


## By John Barry


This is my first chatbot project I worked to create during my internship with Moment AI. 
A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating in some fashion with humans.
The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses.
The data set used to trained the chatbot can be found here: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html
